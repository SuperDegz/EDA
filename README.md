# Exploratory Data Analysis on Spotify 2023 Dataset

This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of popular Spotify tracks. Through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, it uncovers trends and insights into what makes a song popular on the platform. Key features such as genre, popularity score, release year, and audio characteristics (like danceability, energy, and tempo) are examined to reveal patterns in popular music. The findings from this analysis can help in understanding music trends, identifying features correlated with popularity, and providing a data-driven foundation for further exploration.

Problems Encounter: 

1. â€¢When loading my dataset I encountered a UnicodeDecodeError (10-26-2024):

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
    
print(greet("GitHub"))
```
